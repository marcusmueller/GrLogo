My reproduction of the GNU Radio Logo

Since I did not invent that logo but reproduced it for the purpose of promoting GNU Radio, I don't claim any copyright on these pictures.
In fact, if you asked me, you could do whatever you want, as long as you use it in reference to GNU Radio.

If you want to modify these files to make your own GR Logo, feel free to do so.
